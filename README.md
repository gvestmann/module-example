# module-example

This is simple Bootstrap-site I whipped up for demo-ing my module "Flying Death Star", which I made for a school assignment on modules, package managers and bundlers. For the sake of that, I used Parcel for development and built the site via Netlify.com.

All the necessary stuff for the module is in ./floating-death-star folder; the css and js file, plus the Death Star itself in all it's glory. If you want to know more about the module, head to it's repo. There you'll find some code-comments in fly.js file.

The demo can be seen [HERE](https://suspicious-curran-179704.netlify.app/).
